Use and adjust as need to work for you with you WM's!

Here you will find my Dot Files and Scripts I use for my LeftWM / SpectrWM setup that I use on my EndeavourOS Arch install... I also use these on my Linux Mint, my BTW Arch, MX 19 and others when I get a chance... Some of these files were borrowed from OTB, DT, Linux Dabbler and other sources. I don't remember where I got them all but here they are! I know some of the script might not be worded right adn I am not a programer by anymeans but they work for me. Edit them as you wish... Make then work for you! I have included all my ~/bin files for plublic use. Also my Polybar, Rofi, and other files, my config file, Thenes build files.. Enjoy!
