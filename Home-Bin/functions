Interactive scripts belong more into the domain of DOS than of UNIX.

Code:
#!/bin/sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install $*


You can also adapt it to fit into your bashrc, so you don't need an extra file for this.

Code:
function install
{
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install $*
}


If you really want to print a status message at the end, you should check the return
value to see if the operation was successfull.

Code:
function install
{
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install $*
   [[ "$?" -eq 0 ]] && echo "Success" || echo "Operation failed"
}
