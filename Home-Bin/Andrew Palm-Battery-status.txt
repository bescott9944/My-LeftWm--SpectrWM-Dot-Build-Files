I recall using bash, acpi, cut, and sed, to get a battery status in my Herbstluftwm dzen-based panel.
It was modified from someone else's work, I think, but still very satisfying when it eventually worked.  

fgcolor="#cfcfcf"
batt() {
  # For Battery 0
  charge=$(acpi | cut -d "," -f 2 | sed -n '1p')
  state=$(acpi | cut -d " " -f 3 | sed -n '1p')
  # For Battery 1 (needed sometimes when using bluetooth mouse)
  #charge=$(acpi | sed "1 d" | cut -d "," -f 2 | sed -n '1p')
  #state=$(acpi | sed "1 d" | cut -d " " -f 3 | sed -n '1p')
  if [ "$state" = "Full," ]; then
    statech="F"
  elif [ "$state" = "Discharging," ]; then
    statech="D"
  elif [ "$state" = "Charging," ]; then
    statech="C"
  fi
  echo -n "^fg($fgcolor)Batt: $statech $charge^fg($fgcolor)"
  return
}

Since you asked, ;), what I would have done differently:

if [ "$STATUS" = "Charging" ] 
then
        ICON="<lightning emoji>"
else
       ICON="<battery emoji>"
fi
echo "$ICON I${INTERNAL}% E${EXTERNAL}%"

Not using the brackets as status bar real estate is scarce so the smaller we can make it the better.

The other thing you can do is a notification as the Mate desktop does. You can use a program called notify-send and a daemon called dunst (as dwm doesn't have a notification service built in like say Mate). I'll leave you to look into that if you fancy it.
