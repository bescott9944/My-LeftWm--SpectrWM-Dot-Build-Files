__> DATE AND TIME FORMAT REFERENCE - STRFTIME <__

-------------------------------------------------

IBM Workload Scheduler uses the strftime standard method for defining the presentation of the date and time in log files generated by CCLog. There is a parameter in the properties file of CCLog, where you define the format (see IBM Workload Scheduler logging and tracing using CCLog).

This parameter uses one or more of the following variables, each of which is introduced by a "%" sign, separated, if required, by spaces or other character separators.

For example, to define a date and time stamp that would produce the following (12-hour time, followed by the date) "7:30:49 a.m. - November 7, 2008", you would use the following definition:
%l:%M:%S %P - %B %e, %G

The full details of the parameters you can use are as follows:
Table 1. strftime date and time format parameters
Parameter
Description
Example
%a	The abbreviated weekday name according to the current locale.	Wed
%A	The full weekday name according to the current locale.	Wednesday
%b	The abbreviated month name according to the current locale.	Jan
%B	The full month name according to the current locale.	January
%c	The preferred date and time representation for the current locale.	
%C	The century number (year/100) as a 2-digit integer.	19
%d	The day of the month as a decimal number (range 01 to 31).	07
%D	Equivalent to %m/%d/%y. (This is the USA date format. In many countries %d/%m/%y is the standard date format. Thus, in an international context, both of these formats are ambiguous and must be avoided.)	12/25/04
%e	Like %d, the day of the month as a decimal number, but a leading zero is replaced by a space.	7
%G	The ISO 8601 year with century as a decimal number. The 4-digit year corresponding to the ISO week number (see %V). This has the same format and value as %y, except that if the ISO week number belongs to the previous or next year, that year is used instead.	2008
%g	Like %G, but without century, i.e., with a 2-digit year (00-99).	04
%h	Equivalent to %b.	Jan
%H	The hour as a decimal number using a 24-hour clock (range 00 to 23).	22
%I	The hour as a decimal number using a 12-hour clock (range 01 to 12).	07
%j	The day of the year as a decimal number (range 001 to 366).	008
%k	The hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number (range 0 to 23); single digits are preceded by a blank. (See also %H.)	7
%l	The hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number (range 1 to 12); single digits are preceded by a blank. (See also %I.)	7
%m	The month as a decimal number (range 01 to 12).	04
%M	The minute as a decimal number (range 00 to 59).	58
%n	A newline character.	
%p	Either `AM' or `PM' according to the given time value, or the corresponding strings for the current locale. Noon is treated as `pm' and midnight as `am'.	AM
%P	Like %p but in lowercase: `am' or `pm' or a corresponding string for the current locale.	am
%r	The time in a.m. or p.m. notation. In the POSIX locale this is equivalent to `%I:%M:%S %p'.	07:58:40 am
%R	The time in 24-hour notation (%H:%M). For a version including the seconds, see %T below.	07:58
%s	The number of seconds since the Epoch, i.e., since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC.	1099928130
%S	The second as a decimal number (range 00 to 61). the upper level of the range 61 rather than 59 to allow for the occasional leap second and even more occasional double leap second.	07
%t	A tab character.	
%T	The time in 24-hour notation (%H:%M:%S).	17:58:40
%u	The day of the week as a decimal, range 1 to 7, Monday being 1. See also %w.	3
%U	The week number of the current year as a decimal number, range 00 to 53, starting with the first Sunday as the first day of week 01. See also %V and %W.	26
%V	The ISO 8601:1988 week number of the current year as a decimal number, range 01 to 53, where week 1 is the first week that has at least 4 days in the current year, and with Monday as the first day of the week. See also %U and %W.	26
%w	The day of the week as a decimal, range 0 to 6, Sunday being 0. See also %u.	5
%W	The week number of the current year as a decimal number, range 00 to 53, starting with the first Monday as the first day of week 01.	34
%x	The preferred date representation for the current locale without the time.	
%X	The preferred time representation for the current locale without the date.	
%y	The year as a decimal number without a century (range 00 to 99).	04
%Y	The year as a decimal number including the century.	2008
%z	The time-zone as hour offset from GMT. Required to emit RFC822-conformant dates (using "%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %z").	-2
%Z	The time zone or name or abbreviation.	GMT
%%	A literal `%' character.	%
