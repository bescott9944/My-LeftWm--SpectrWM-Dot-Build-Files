# Bash file for CudaText Editor a direct replacement for Sublime. 07/25/2021
# CudaText is a cross-platform text editor, written in Object Pascal. It is
# open source project and can be used free of charge, even for business.
# It starts quite fast: ~0.3 sec with ~30 plugins, on Linux on CPU Intel Core
# i3 3GHz. It is extensible by Python add-ons: plugins, linters, code
# tree parsers, external tools. Syntax parser is feature-rich, based on
# EControl engine (though not as fast as in some competitors).
# CudaText GitHub: https://cudatext.github.io/

# CudaText does not have a install, you just place it where you want.
